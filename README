*===========================*

Perl Moose Role that extends L<MooseX::Getopt> to provide usage printing
that inspects your classes meta information to build a (coloured) usage
message including that meta information.


SYNOPSIS

    ## In your class
    package My::App;
    use Moose;

    with 'MooseX::Getopt::Usage';

    has verbose => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Bool', default => 0,
        documentation => qq{Say lots about what we are doing} );

    has gumption => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Int', default => 23,
        documentation => qq{How much gumption to apply} );

    # ... rest of class

    ## In your script
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use My::App;
    my $app = My::App->new_with_options;
